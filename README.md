# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm i`
install the libraries before you run the project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

* note: you should be able to run the react app in the localhost:3000 port. If not you will face the Cors error. For more detail read the readme.md file of https://github.com/lakshmadu/expernetic-todo-api project

* if you need to change Back end API url, then checkout .env file and change this code: REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL = http://localhost:5195

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
